# Two Channel Relay Module

This is the blueprint for a 2-Channel relay module that can be driven by 5V like a usual one.

What is unusual are the SMD LEDs placed instead of the THT ones.
This makes the PCB designing more challenging (not for the practical design but for the aesthetic or theoritical one).

The component is a little immature but seem to be prettier and a bit amusing.
## Demo

The project is supposed to be opened with KiCad EDA. The file with the extension .kicad_pro work the same as a main file.

In the plotted pdf file, there included the schematic diagram of the whole circuit. Even the mounting holes are not excluded.

The pictures of the PCB design and 3D view for demo purpose are provided for under the "images" folder.
